1. What type would you choose for the following “numbers”?
    A person’s telephone number. ---string
    A person’s height ---float
    A person’s age    ---int
    A person’s gender (Male, Female, Prefer Not To Answer)     ---enum
    A person’s salary           ---decimal
    A book’s ISBN               ---string
    A book’s price              ---decimal
    A book’s shipping weight    ---float
    A country’s population      ---int
    The number of stars in the universe     ---decimal
    The number of employees in each of the small or medium businesses in the     
    United Kingdom (up to about 50,000 employees per business)      ---int


2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is
boxing and unboxing?
    -value type variables are immutable value which store the actual data in stack memory
    -reference type variables are mutable. they store a reference to their data and the actual data is stored in the heap.
    -boxing is to convert the value type  to reference type variables
    -unboxing is to convert the reference type  to value type variables
    
3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET
    -Managed resource is handled directly by .NET runtime and be tracked and automatically managed by .NET garbage collector.
    -Unmanaged resource is nor automatically cleaned up by the garbage collector. Require manual cleanup.

4. What the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?
    -The Garbage collector is to simplify memory management, increase reliability and improve performance in .NET application 
    by automatically handling the allocation and deallocation of managed memory.
    
    
    

    Controlling Flow and Converting Types
  
    1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
        It results in a DivideByZeroException at runtime. The operation is illegal and cannot be performed.
        
    2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
        It results in Infinity or -Infinity, depending on the sign of the numerator. If you divide 0 by 0, re result is NaN.
        
    3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its
    range?
        In checked context, this will throw an OverflowException. In unchecked context, it wraps around, causing the variable to cycle through the maximum and minimum values.
        
    4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
        y++ returns the current value of y before incrementing it, so x will receive the original value of y. In contrast, ++y increments y first and then returns the new value, so x will receive the incremented value.
    
    5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop
    statement?
        break: Exits the loop entirely and transfers control to the statement following the loop.
        continue: Skips the current iteration and jumps to the next iteration of the loop.
        return: Exits the current method and optionally returns a value to the caller, ending the entire method execution, not just the loop.
    
    6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
        The three parts of a for statement are:
        Initialization: (e.g., int i = 0)
        Condition: (e.g., i < 10)
        Iteration: (e.g., i++)
        Only the condition is required; the other two can be omitted.
        
    7.What is the difference between the = and == operators?
        = is used to assign a value to a variable
        == is used to compare two values for equality, it returns true ofr false.
    
    8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
        Yes, because the condition is 'true'
    
    9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
        In a switch expression, the underscore _ is used as a discard pattern or default case. It represents a "catch-all" for any values that do not match previous cases
    
    10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach
    statement?
        Objects must implement IEnumerable or IEnumerable<T> to be iterated with foreach
