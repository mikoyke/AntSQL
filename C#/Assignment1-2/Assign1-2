an array?
    Use .length
    eg. int[] numbers = {1,2,3};  int totalElements = numbers.Length

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
    No, it can only store the same data type.

6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
    System.Array.CopyTo() copies the elements of one array to another existing array. 
    We need to provide the target array adn the starting index for copying.
    
    System.Array.Clone() creates a shallow copy of the entire array and returns it as an object.
